Summary(Optional) :   This project focuses on analyzing a dataset called "Robot Kinematics Dataset" that contains joint values and corresponding Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z) of a robot manipulator. The main tasks include understanding how the joint values are generated, determining the relationship between joint values and Cartesian coordinates, identifying the influential joint variables, visualizing the relationship between joint values and coordinates, and detecting any unusual patterns or anomalies. The project aims to build a regression model, possibly using a neural network algorithm, to predict Cartesian coordinates based on joint values. The dataset offers insights into robot manipulator kinematics and provides opportunities for optimizing performance.
